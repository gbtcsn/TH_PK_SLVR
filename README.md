# TH_PK_SLVR
A very basic python based GTO Texas Hold'em poker solver for people who want to understand the basics of the game and the theoretical approach behind optimal play


This project represents a study on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategy applied to No-Limit Texas Hold'em Poker, with a focus on the development and analysis of a Python-based Poker solver. The research question guiding this project is: "How can a GTO solver for No-Limit Texas Hold'em Poker be developed and what are the key concepts involved in such a solver and in GTO poker?"

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS

The Equity Array class can definetely be optimized, it is slow and inefficient. A possible solution could be to save the analysis of the hand and board as a file so that calculations won't have to be reiterated every time one runs the algorithm.
